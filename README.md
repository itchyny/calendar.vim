## Installation
Install with your favorite plugin manager.

## Google Calendar and Google Task
In order to view and edit calendars on Google Calendar, or task on Google Task,
add the following configurations to your vimrc file.
```vim
let g:calendar_google_calendar = 1
let g:calendar_google_task = 1
```
It requires `wget` or `curl`.

### Important notice
The default client key is not provided anymore and you will get the **Authorization Error**.
You have to create your own Google API key and use for authentication with the following steps.

- Create a new project in [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) and go to [Google APIs](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/).
- Click `ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES` add `Google Calendar API` and `Tasks API`.
- Go to [Google APIs](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/) and click `OAuth consent screen` from the sidebar.
  - Choose `External` (Available to any user with a Google Account.) and click `CREATE`.
  - Input your favorite name to `Application name`. In the `Scopes for Google APIs` section, click `Add scope` and add `Google Calendar API ../auth/calendar` and `Task API ../auth/tasks`.
  - Click `Save` (DO NOT `Submit for verification`).
- Go to the `Credentials` page from the sidebar.
  - Create a new API key and restrict key to the two APIs (`Google Calendar API`, `Tasks API`).
    - You have the api key.
  - Create a new `OAuth client ID`. Select `Desktop application` for the application type.
    - You have the client id and client secret.
- Open your terminal and save the credentials.
  - `mkdir -p ~/.cache/calendar.vim/ && touch ~/.cache/calendar.vim/credentials.vim`
  - `chmod 700 ~/.cache/calendar.vim && chmod 600 ~/.cache/calendar.vim/credentials.vim`
  - `vi ~/.cache/calendar.vim/credentials.vim`
  - Add the following three lines and save it. Please be sure to keep this file securely.
```vim
let g:calendar_google_api_key = '...'
let g:calendar_google_client_id = '....apps.googleusercontent.com'
let g:calendar_google_client_secret = '...'
```
  - Add `source ~/.cache/calendar.vim/credentials.vim` to your .vimrc.
- Restart Vim and open calendar.vim. You will get the unverified message but click `Advanced` and `Go to your-app (unsafe)`.
- Approve against some confirms (maybe three clicks) and you will get the login code. Copy and paste it into the prompt of calendar.vim. Now you'll be authenticated to your application..
